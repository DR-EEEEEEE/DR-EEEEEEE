### 🧠 About Me

- 🎛️ Passionate about **hardware-first development**, especially **custom PCBs** and **embedded systems**
- 📐 Designing boards that actually *work* – and sometimes catch fire (but only once!)
- 🧵 I speak fluent **I²C**, **SPI**, **UART**, and just enough **C** to scare a compiler
- ⚒️ Firmware + bare-metal programming with STM32, ESP32, RP2040 & friends
- 💻 Learning ``Java`` & ``Python`` to build small tools and helper apps that make hardware life easier
- 🔋 I believe in efficient power design, neat traces, and unholy amounts of test points
- 😄 Pronouns: e/E
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a mild obsession with the letter **E** – and by "mild" I mean **extreme**

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **MCUs:** nRF52, STM32, ESP32, RP2040, ATmega
- **PCB Tools:** KiCad, EasyEDA, Fusion360 (sometimes)
- **Firmware:** C/C++, MicroPython
- **Debugging:** SWD, Logic Analyzers, Oscilloscopes, and sheer willpower
- **Other:** Soldering, Rework, Prototyping
